
For v1.0.16
===========


For Future
==========
model mixins

Plastic to override methods with default values
 - see compilerDoc::ApiDocParser.parseMethod() 

Models to take Strs, not Types, so you can add auto-gen types as fields.



Naa - Bad Ideas
===============

check field types and method return types are public 
 - actually don't, they may be internal to the pod, and we're repeating work of the Fantom compiler
