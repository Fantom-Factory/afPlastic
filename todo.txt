
For v1.0.2
==========
useType should take 'as TypeB'
better facet handling for fields
facet handling for classes and methods 


For Future
==========
model mixins
compile multiple models into one pod

Plastic to override methods with default values
 - see compilerDoc::ApiDocParser.parseMethod() 



Naa - Bad Ideas
===============

check field types and method return types are public 
 - actually don't, they may be internal to the pod, and we're repeating work of the Fantom compiler
